This section supports custom metafields from Collections and Products.

üß∑ Collection Metafield: Countdown

Path: collection.metafields.custom.countdown  
Type: Date

This metafield controls the countdown timer for the sale banner.

> When the value is in the future, the banner is displayed under the product grid.

‚≠ê Product Metafields

These are used inside tpl_product-card.liquid.

| Metafield                              | Type             | Purpose                                                    |

| product.metafields.custom.custom_label | Single line text | Display custom label on product cards (e.g. ‚ÄúBest Seller‚Äù) |

üí° You can update the product card snippet to render these fields visually.

5. Storefront API & Dev App Access

You‚Äôll need to:

1. Create a private Shopify App or a custom app from the Partner Dashboard
2. Enable Storefront API access
3. Copy the Storefront API access token
4. Paste it into the JS code here:

headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
'X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token': 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'
}

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

- Compatible with all modern Shopify themes (Online Store 2.0+)
